Circuit for proving the correct encryption under BFV fully homomorphic encryption scheme. Note that this can be also generalized to any RLWE-based algorithms. Paper -> https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/594. The implementation manages the public inputs of the circuit [in a slightly different way](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/greco/pull/30) than the one described in the paper.
